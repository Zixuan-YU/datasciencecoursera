#### Course Description

In this course you will learn how to program in R and how to use R for
effective data analysis. You will learn how to install and configure
software necessary for a statistical programming environment and
describe generic programming language concepts as they are implemented
in a high-level statistical language. The course covers practical issues
in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data
into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, profiling
R code, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical data
analysis will provide working examples.

#### Course Syllabus

#### Course Description

Before you can work with data you have to get some. This course will
cover the basic ways that data can be obtained. The course will cover
obtaining data from the web, from APIs, from databases and from
colleagues in various formats. It will also cover the basics of data
cleaning and how to make data “tidy”. Tidy data dramatically speed
downstream data analysis tasks. The course will also cover the
components of a complete data set including raw data, processing
instructions, codebooks, and processed data. The course will cover the
basics needed for collecting, cleaning, and sharing data.

#### Course Syllabus

-   Data collection
    -   Raw files (.csv,.xlsx)
    -   Databases (mySQL,MongoDB)
    -   APIs
-   Data formats
    -   Flat files (.csv,.txt)
    -   XML
    -   JSON
-   Making data tidy
-   Distributing data
-   Scripting for data cleaning

#### Course Projects

The Course Projects focus on plotting and will be assessed via peer
assessment. In these assignments, you will be asked to conduct data
analysis and you will be evaluated by your classmates on the work and
code that you write. Assignments evaluated via peer assessment will make
use of your GitHub account or the RPubs web site.
